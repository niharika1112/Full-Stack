## API 
---
You can think of APIs as being like a waiter at a restaurant, serving as a go-between for the customer and the kitchen.     

A customer who wants soup doesn't go into the kitchen to cook. They don't even have to know how to make soup! They only have to know how to ask the waiter for soup, expecting the waiter to bring back soup.

## Types of APIs

Multiple API types may be used to achieve a task. For example, uploading a photo to Instagram makes use of various APIs:

Hardware API for the app to talk to your camera

Software library API for the image to be processed with filters

Web API for sending your image to Instagram's servers so your friends can like it!

** There is more than one way to build and consume APIs. Some architecture types you may come across are:
---
*REST (Representational State Transfer)  

*GraphQL

*WebSockets

*webhooks

*SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)

*gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)

*MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport)
---
APIs also vary in the scope of who can access them.

*Public APIs (aka Open APIs)
Consumed by anyone who discovers the API

*Private APIs
Consumed only within an organization and not made public

*Partner APIs
Consumed between one or more organizations that have an established relationship
